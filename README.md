# SCPSLTranquilizer
Remade the tranquilizer mod for SCP:SL (The old one was broken I think)

# Features:
* Every COM15 has been turned into a tranquilizer.
* Shoot SCPs and humans to knock them out.
  - SCPs and humans have different times they can stay knocked out.
* Shoot knocked out SCPs
* Pacify 096
  - 096 won't be knocked out but rather, unable to become enraged for the amount of time he would stay out
